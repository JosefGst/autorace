Autorace provides hardware components and example codes to achieve vision-based autonomous racing on RC-Cars. It is developed by [RAM-LAB](https://www.ram-lab.com/) to support *the 1st autonomous RC-Car racing competition* in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The competition data is Feb 26, 2021 (tentative).

**Event Collaborators**: School of Engineering, Robotics Institue (RI), Robotics and Multiperception Lab (RAM-LAB), Intelligent Autonomous Driving Center, Entrepreneurship Center

**Keywords:** autonomous racing, visual navigation, artifical intelligence, deep learning.

## System Installation

### Jetson Nano on the RC-Car 
*This is for data collection and model deployment*

### Your Host PC
*This is for AI model training*


*For the participants who do not have a NVIDIA graphics card (GPU) in their computer, they can apply for using a server to train their models.*
#### Server usage

```console
$ ssh -p 1234 team1@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

## Train a Self-driving Car

### Data Collection
Randomly place different obstacles on the track.

```console
$ python manage.py drive --js
```

### Model Training
```console
$ python manage.py train --model models/resnet18.pth --type resnet18
```

#### Accelerate your model
```console
$ python accel_model.py --model models/resnet18.pth --half --type resnet18
```
### Model Testing
```console
$ python manage.py drive --model models/resnet18_trt.pth --half --trt --type resnet18
```

## Notes

1. Remember to configure the system on Jetson Nano to 5W mode to increase battery life (default: MAXN) `sudo nvpmodel -m1`
2. Do not directly turn off the power when system is running. Open a terminal and do`sudo shutdown`first to shutdown the OS system, then turn off the power.
3. If the RC-Car crashes into the track fence at a high speed, the front wheels are likely to get stuck at their drive rods. Then you need to remove the two drive rods and reinstall them, which is a little troublesome. *It is suggested to simply remove the drive rod of the two front wheels, then this problem can be solved.*
