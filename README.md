# Features
* Coding language: *Python3*
* Deep learning framework: [*PyTorch 1.6*](https://pytorch.org/)
* On-board computer: [*Jetson Nano B1*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/)
* Complete pipeline of data collection, model training and testing
* Easy to use and DIY
* What can you ahieves ü§î?

    1. Build a small but powerful RC-Car that can drive itself.
    2. Record driving data (camera images, control actions) by teleoperating the RC-Car.
    3. Train different AI autopilots to drive your car on the track as fast as possible.
    4. Autonomous collision avoidance around different obstacles.

# System inatallation

## Jetson Nano on the RC-Car 
*This is for data collection and model deployment*

## Your Host PC
*This is for AI model training*


*For the participants who do not have a NVIDIA graphics card (GPU) in their computer, they can apply for using a server to train their models.*
### Server usage

```
ssh -p 1234 team1@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

# Start to train your own self-driving car (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)

## Data Collection
```
python manage.py drive --js
```

## Model Training and Acceleration
```
python manage.py train --model models/resnet18.pth --type resnet18
```

```
python accel_model.py --model models/resnet18.pth --half --type resnet18
```
## Model Testing
```
python manage.py drive --model models/resnet18_trt.pth --half --trt --type resnet18
```

# Notes

1. Remember to configure the system on Jetson Nano to 5W mode to increase battery life (default: MAXN) `sudo nvpmodel -m1`
2. Do not turn off the power directly when system is running. Open a terminal and do`sudo shutdown`first to shutdown the OS system, then turn off the power.
3. ...
